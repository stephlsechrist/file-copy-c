# CSC 415 - Project 2 - File copy

## Student Name : Stephanie Sechrist

## Build Instructions
Clone the repo into your local directory. In Linux terminal, type
```
make
```
to compile the program. This will follow the instructions in Makefile to build program. 

## Run Instructions
Next, type
```
./fc
```
to run the file copy program in the terminal.
